# AI-Job-Market-Trends Project

This project analyzes trends in AI-related job postings to understand key patterns in skills demand, salary distributions, and market shifts across countries, industries, and work types.

üìä Overview

We use a dataset of AI job postings containing variables such as salary, required skills, experience, remote work ratio, education level, industry, and more. The analysis includes:
	
	‚Ä¢	Descriptive Statistics & Visualizations: General distributions of salary, experience, remote types, and top industries hiring AI talent.

	‚Ä¢	Skill Demand Analysis: Word clouds, combination analysis, and cluster analysis using NLP methods to identify skill groupings and high-paying combinations.

	‚Ä¢	Salary Prediction Modeling: Using Random Forest regression to understand key salary drivers and feature importances.

	‚Ä¢	Scenario Simulations: Comparing predicted salaries across different remote work types, education levels, company sizes, and industries.

üî• Key Insights

	‚Ä¢	Years of experience and company location are the strongest predictors of salary.

	‚Ä¢	Remote work flexibility and higher education levels contribute to modest salary increases.

	‚Ä¢	Python, TensorFlow, and cloud tools (like GCP, Azure) are top skills in high-salary roles. 

	‚Ä¢	Large companies pay more consistently across industries.
